## Courses Manager - NestJs/Angular Training App

This app is based on the boilerplate of ["NestJs In Practice" course](https://github.com/angular-university/nestjs-course/tree/1-start). The Angular was pre-written by the course's tutor and the backend NestJs API is self-written based on the course's documentation and NestJs Documentation.

# Running NestJs Backend Server

We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    cd rest-api 
    npm install
    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# Running Angular Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start 

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
